Custom Configuration Manager for OPNsense

This plugin provides a GUI for managing:
- DNS-based VPN bypass (route specific domains around VPN)
- Monit process monitors (auto-restart crashed processes)
- Custom configuration files (arbitrary file management)

All settings are stored in config.xml and backed up with normal backups.
